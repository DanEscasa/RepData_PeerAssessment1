# Introduction {.unnumbered}

*Excerpts from the [original
repo](https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1) from which this
was forked*

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or [Jawbone
Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of the
"quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find
patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these
data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain
and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing
and interpreting the data.

This project makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device which collects data at five-minute intervals through out the day.

The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual
collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include
the number of steps taken in five-minute intervals each day.

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

|               | (missing values are coded as `NA`)                |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

|               | YYYY-MM-DD format                                   |

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

The following are the questions to be addressed:

-   What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

-   What is the average daily activity pattern?

-   Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and
    weekends?

# Now let's get cooking

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Compute the total number, mean, and median steps per day.
As an aside, take note of the use of the superassignment (`<<-`) instead of the usual assignment operator (`<-`). This is because the `with(){}` creates its own scope.

```r
with(data = activity,{
     totalDaySteps  <<- aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum)
     meanDaySteps   <<- aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = mean)
     medianDaySteps <<- aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = median)
})
```
For convenience, merge the three into one dataframe and assign meaningful `colnames()`.


```r
dayStats <- merge(totalDaySteps, meanDaySteps, by = "Group.1")
dayStats <- merge(dayStats, medianDaySteps, by = "Group.1")
colnames(dayStats) <- c("date", "totalSteps", "meanSteps", "medianSteps")
```

Plot total number of steps taken each day, telling `barplot()` to remove spaces between bars. Also, using `(as.Date(date) - as.Date(totalDaySteps[1, 1]) + 1)` as `names.arg` so labels on x axis are day numbers, not the dates. This is so the plot is neater.

```r
with(dayStats,
     barplot(space = 0, totalSteps,
             main  = "Total Number of Steps per Day",
             xlab  = "Day", ylab = "Total Steps", 
             names.arg = (as.Date(date) - as.Date(totalDaySteps[1, 1]) + 1)))
```

Plot mean of number of steps per day.

```r
with(dayStats, 
     barplot(space = 0, meanSteps, 
             main  = "Average Number of Steps per Day",
             xlab  = "Day", ylab = "Average Steps", 
             names.arg = (as.Date(date) - as.Date(totalDaySteps[1, 1]) + 1)))

|2012-11-30 |         NA|

Lastly, plot the median number of steps per day.

```r
with(dayStats, 
     barplot(space = 0, medianSteps, 
             main  = "Median Number of Steps per Day",
             xlab  = "Day", ylab = "Median Steps", 
             names.arg = (as.Date(date) - as.Date(totalDaySteps[1, 1]) + 1)))
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
dev.copy(png, "plots/03-medianSteps.png")
```

```
## png 
##   3
```

```r
dev.off()
```

```
## png 
##   2
```

Median is zero because of the large number of zero `steps` â€” after all, `steps` is mostly zero, save for an outlier or two, for `interval` from 0 to 530. `NA`s may also account for that.

Since the median is zero for all days, there's no point in presenting the dataframe.

The `summary()` function will also give us similar info:

```r
kable(summary(dayStats))
```



|   |        date  |  totalSteps  |  meanSteps     | medianSteps |
|:--|:-------------|:-------------|:---------------|:------------|

|   |(Other)   :55 |NA's   :8     |NA's   :8       |NA's   :8    |

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
_Create a dataframe with steps per interval, and plot the line._

Define a function that will take an integer -- in this case, the interval -- and convert it to a `time` string.

```r
int2Time <- function(hhmm) {
     # separate the integer into its minute and hour components
     # assumes an integer of the form hhmm, where hh and mm are the hour
     # (between 0-23) and minute (between 0-59) components, respectively, of the
     # time.
     # Does not do parameter validation
     startHr  <- hhmm %/% 100
     startMin <- hhmm %% 100
     # and put them back together 
     return(paste0(substring(paste0("0", startHr), nchar(startHr)),
                   ":",
                   substring(paste0("0", startMin), nchar(startMin))))
}
```
Average the number of steps over each five-minute interval and plot the time series.

```r
intervalSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, mean)
intervalSteps$time <- as.POSIXct(int2Time(intervalSteps$interval), format = "%H:%M", tz = "MST")
ggplot(intervalSteps, aes(x = time, y = steps)) +
     geom_line() +
     scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%H:%M", tz = "MST"), 
                      date_breaks = "2 hours") +
     labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken Per Day", 
          x = "Time of Day", y = "Average Steps") +
     theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
dev.copy(png, "plots/04-intervalSteps.png")
```

```
## png 
##   3
```

```r
dev.off()
```

```
## png 
##   2
```

So, from the plot, on average there is negligible activity from midnight (see below) to around 5:30 in the morning, slowly climbing at around 7:00, and a spike of over 200 steps at around 8:30.

From then on, there is a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 100 steps, and activity dies down starting close to 11:30 PM.

_Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?_

The starting time and corresponding average number of steps are in `intervalSteps[which.max(intervalSteps$steps), 1]` and `intervalSteps[which.max(intervalSteps$steps), 2]` respectively. I thought I'd include the end time of that interval by adding five minutes.

```r
intervalStart <- intervalSteps[which.max(intervalSteps$steps), 1]
intervalEnd   <- intervalSteps[which.max(intervalSteps$steps), 1] + 5
averageSteps  <- intervalSteps[which.max(intervalSteps$steps), 2]
```
Since the steps from interval 0 to interval 600 are mostly zero, I'm betting that the measurements start midnight. If they don't, I'm screwed. Or not, maybe just have to make adjustments in the conversions.

What I'm fairly sure of is that the intervals are of the form `hhmm`, where `hh` and `mm` are the hour and minute components, respectively, of the interval. As evidence, `interval` on the 24th row is 155, and on the 25th is 200. Examine the 36th and 37th rows, and `interval` goes from 255 to 300. Where are 160, 165,â€¦, between 15 and 200, or 260, 265,â€¦, between 255 and 300? First, 160 is equivalent to 200, and 260 to 300. That's further evidence that the `interval`s *are* time stamps, of the form `hhmm`.

Output will be in 24-hour format.

```r
sprintf("Maximum number of steps on average taken from %s to %s, number of steps = %f",
        int2Time(intervalStart), int2Time(intervalEnd), averageSteps)
```

```
## [1] "Maximum number of steps on average taken from 08:35 to 08:40, number of steps = 206.169811"
```
## Imputing missing values
First question: how many missing values are there?

```r
missing <- is.na(activity$steps)
sprintf("Number of missing steps: %s.", f_comma(sum(missing), mark = ","))
```

```
## [1] "Number of missing steps: 2,304."
```

```r
sprintf("Mean: %s.", mean(missing))
```

```
## [1] "Mean: 0.131147540983607."
```
So, do those 2,304 `NA`s make a difference? Let's find out.

Define a helper function `fillNA`.

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter     | Description                                         |
+===============+=====================================================+
| steps         | Cell to be converted, if `NA`, to the average number of steps for `interval` (second parameter)           |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| interval      | Identifier for the five-minute interval from which to get the mean number of steps. The function will match  `intervalSteps$interval` with the parameter `interval`, and return the average steps if the `steps` parameter is `NA`                              |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

```r
fillNA <- function(steps, interval) {
  return(ifelse 
         (!is.na(steps), steps,
           intervalSteps[intervalSteps$interval == interval, "steps"]))
}
```
Make a copy of `activity`, then apply `fillNA` to that copy.

```r
adjActivity       <- activity
adjActivity$steps <- mapply(fillNA, 
                            adjActivity$steps, 
                            adjActivity$interval)
```
Set up the plot, then plot it.

```r
adjSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = adjActivity, mean)
with(adjSteps, 
     barplot(space = 0, steps, 
             main  = "Average Number of Steps per Day, NA imputed",
             xlab  = "Day", ylab = "Average Steps", 
             names.arg = (as.Date(date) - as.Date(date[1]) + 1)))
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
dev.copy(png, "plots/05-imputedSteps.png")
```

```
## png 
##   3
```
Compare that with the plot of Average Number of Steps per Day, without imputing `NA`s:

```r
knitr::include_graphics("plots/02-meanSteps.png")
```

<img src="plots/02-meanSteps.png" width="400px" />

Without the imputed data, average steps for days 1, 8, 32, 35, 40, 41, 45, and 61 are zero because of the `NA` steps for those days. Imputing creates data points that look reasonable, consistent in height with the other data points.

Meanwhile, the heights for the other days don't show any appreciable change.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Create a new Boolean column that determines whether the day is a weekday or weekend.

```r
adjActivity$is.Weekday <- timeDate::isWeekday(adjActivity$date)
```

Take the mean number of steps per interval broken down into `is.Weekday` and `!is.Weekday`

```r
stepsPerInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + is.Weekday, data = adjActivity, mean)
```

Use the `interval` column to create a `time` column.

```r
stepsPerInterval$time <- as.POSIXct(int2Time(intervalSteps$interval), format = "%H:%M", tz = "MST")
```

Map the `is.Weekday` column to the more readable "Weekend" and "Weekday".

```r
is.Weekday.labs <- as_labeller(c("FALSE" = "Weekend", "TRUE" = "Weekday"))
ggplot(stepsPerInterval, aes(time, steps, col = factor(is.Weekday))) +
  facet_wrap(.~factor(is.Weekday), dir = "v", 
             labeller = is.Weekday.labs) +
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Time of day", y = "Steps") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot Comparison of Steps") +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%H:%M", tz = "MST"), date_breaks = "2 hours") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```r
dev.copy(png, "plots/06-WkDayVsWkEnd.png")
```

The plot tells us that on both weekends and weekdays, the subjects are on average inactive, possibly asleep, from midnight to 5:30 in the morning. However, inactivity on weekends stretches to about 8:00 AM, whereas the subjects start moving about 5:30 AM on weekdays. Activity on both weekends and weekdays spike at 9:00 AM, although to a lesser extent for the former.

Oddly, activity from 10:00 AM all the way to 5:30 PM is heavier on weekends, then wane at 11:00 PM for both weekends and weekdays.
